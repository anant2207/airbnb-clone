Airbnb Clone
This is an Airbnb clone project that I built using the MERN stack, including Vite, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to register, login, add places, and book them.

Features:-
• User registration and login
• Add places
• Book places
• View a list of places
• View a map of places

The website is hosted at https://anant22-frontend.mdbgo.io/.
